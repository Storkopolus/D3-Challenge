# D3-Challenge

## Background 
This repository was developed to better understand data visualization and can compare Poverty %, Median Age, or Median Household income to obesity rates, smoking rates, and rates of indiviauls not covered by healthcare.  

The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml, includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. 

A plugin developed by Justin Palmer (d3-tip.js) was also included in this coding.
