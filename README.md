# D3-Challenge

## Background 
This repository was developed to better understand data visualization and can compare Poverty % and rates of indiviauls not covered by healthcare.  

The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: https://data.census.gov/cedsci/, includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. 

A plugin developed by Justin Palmer (d3-tip.js) was also included in this coding.
